CodeGrades was recently on the
<a href="https://www.pythonpodcast.com/codegrades-learn-to-program-episode-224/" target="_blank">Podcast.\_\_init\_\_</a>
show where we had lots of fun exploring the links between music and coding
education as a way to explain the concepts behind CodeGrades.

</a>

The host, Tobias, asked plenty of interesting questions, giving us a chance
to explain and unpack the high-level aspects of the project, tell the story
so far and describe the various upcoming milestones. We were also
able to touch upon related projects such as the
[Mu beginner's code editor](https://codewith.mu/) and
[PyperCard](https://pypercard.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) GUI framework, also
aimed at beginner developers.

We were very pleased with Tobias's positive reaction to CodeGrades.
