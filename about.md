This is the blog for [CodeGrades](https://codegrades.com/), a series of
cumulative steps for learning how to code software. They're a programming
version of time-proven techniques like music grades, belts in martial arts or
lifeguard certification. Level up by applying the knowledge and skills needed
for each grade to your own fun, interesting and challenging coding projects.

It'll include news, guest posts and celebrations of the work of participants
involved in CodeGrades.
