<p>This is a blog about <a href="https://codegrades.com/">CodeGrades</a>, an experiment to
help folks learn about programming (initially in Python). We'll use it to
celebrate the successes, learn from the failures and reflect upon the feedback
of participants. We'll also share project news here too.</p>
<p>So, what are CodeGrades?</p>
<p><img alt="Learn, grade, grow" src="/images/learn-grade-grow.png"></p>
<p>At a time when technology is finding its way into every aspect of our lives
many folks want to be more than just passive consumers of technology.
They feel a desire to become creators of technology. They want to take control
of their digital world. They want the skills to make their technology reflect
their own needs.</p>
<p>This is where CodeGrades come in...</p>
<p>CodeGrades are a programming version of time-proven techniques like music
grades or belts in martial arts. Learners level up by
applying the knowledge and skills needed for each grade to their own fun,
interesting and challenging coding projects. Learners present their projects to
professional software developers who assess the projects against the criteria
for the grade being taken and provide a set of marks and written feedback so
the learner can see where they're doing well, what needs to improve and what
their next steps may be.</p>
<p>CodeGrades are eight cumulative steps for learning how to write code. The first
grade is easy enough for most people to take as a first step into programming.
The eighth grade is of equivalent standard to the skills and knowledge needed
to be an effective junior professional software developer. The middle grades
bridge the way so the skill gaps between each of the grades is achievable.
They're like stepping stones into coding, or perhaps a modern day
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gradus_ad_Parnassum">Gradus ad Parnassum</a>.</p>
<p><img alt="Ceci n'est pas une bug" src="/images/treachery_of_bugs.png"></p>
<p>The syllabus for CodeGrades is written by professional software developers. The
grades reflect current best practice found in the software industry. They offer
a framework for sustained and structured long term learning to write code. All
the resources associated with CodeGrades are free, learners only pay to take
the grading. Grades will be competitively priced and will certainly not
cost the many thousands needed to attend a code bootcamp.</p>
<p>Passing a grade is undeniable evidence that an expert programmer believes the
learner has attained the level of competence, knowledge and skill for the grade
taken. Nobody can take that achievement away. It's something to be celebrated
and gives learners the confidence and momentum to continue on
their path to programming mastery.</p>
<p>The professional developers who assess the candidates in a grading (we call
them <em>code mentors</em> because that sounds more friendly than <em>examiners</em>) are
paid for their time at a level comensurate to that of a senior software
engineer. We like to think this may be an alternative source of income for
FLOSS developers who want to concentrate on their software projects rather than
work in an office.</p>
<p>That's it in a nutshell.</p>
<p>It's early days but we have already successfully graduated a first cohort
of learners through "grade 1 Python" (with better than expected outcomes).
We have just started a second cohort of learners to test the new syllabus (more
on that soon) and hope to engage with further test cohorts over the summer.
Eventually we will open up our website so learners will be able to book and pay
for grading. We expect this to happen by the end of 2019 at the latest.</p>
<p>There is still much to do! If you think you could support our work, or perhaps
you have feedback or maybe want to get more involved, please don't hesitate to

<p>Onwards and upwards.</p>
